Pokemon Battle Simulator is an emulation of Pokemon battles from the first generation of Game Boy games.

# What is Pokemon?
Pokemon is a series of turn-based RPGs where characters explore the world of Pokemon. Pokemon trainers seek to collect, breed, and battle their Pokemon to determine who is the best Pokemon trainer, a Pokemon master.

# How does a Pokemon battle work?
-Players take turns selecting either attack, which allows them to pick from four attacks, or switch, which allows them to switch to another Pokemon. You can select menu options by using the numbered keyboard keys.

-Attacks can either deal damage, buff a Pokemon's stats (such as speed or defense), or inflict a status such as paralysis.

-If you don't like the current Pokemon matchup, you can switch to another Pokemon on your team, but you also give your opponent a free attack!

-When all of a fighter's Pokemon faint, the game is over!
